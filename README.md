# Quedicate: E-Platform ticketing
##### Published Site : [Quedicate](https://ghazali.ml/projects/quedicate/)

***

This project is the sole property of *Ghazali* (aka GShacklebolt) and *Md Kasif* (aka Kashif Morningstar). 
We have created a system for platform ticket e-booking with hopes to eliminate the need to stand in long queues. 
The name of our project is a portmanteau of the words Queue + Eradicate: Quedicate.  

The QR Code generator is based on a Github project which is a copyright of Dominik Dzienia which itself is pure-php
LGPL-licensed implementation based on C libqrencode by Kentaro Fukuchi.
